## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Access Hostinger hPanel
1. **Login**: https://hpanel.hostinger.com/websites/sipincafe.co.uk
2. **Navigate**: File Manager
3. **Target Directory**: `/public_html/`

### Step 2: Prepare Hostinger Directory
1. **Backup existing files** (if any)
2. **Clear public_html directory** completely
3. **Ensure clean slate** for new deployment

### Step 3: Upload Files
1. **Upload ALL contents** from `./hostinger-deploy/` folder
2. **Maintain folder structure**:
   ```
   public_html/
   ├── index.html
   ├── _next/
   ├── fonts/
   ├── gallery/
   ├── menu/
   ├── offers/
   ├── robots.txt
   ├── sitemap.xml
   └── ... (all other files)
   ```

### Step 4: Set Permissions
- **Files**: 644 permissions
- **Directories**: 755 permissions
- **Main files**: index.html, robots.txt, etc.

### Step 5: Domain Configuration
1. **DNS Settings**: Ensure domain points to Hostinger
2. **SSL Certificate**: Enable SSL in hPanel
3. **Force HTTPS**: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

## 🌐 Expected Results

### ✅ What Will Work:
- **Homepage**: https://sipincafe.co.uk/
- **Static Pages**: Gallery, Menu, Contact, Blog listing
- **Assets**: Images, fonts, CSS, JavaScript
- **SEO**: robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- **Performance**: Optimized static files

### ⚠️ Limitations (Due to Static Hosting):
- **Dynamic Routes**: Blog posts and dynamic pages won't work
- **Server-Side Features**: No server-side rendering
- **API Routes**: Not available in static hosting

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Full Static Site (Recommended for now)
- Use the current deployment package
- All static pages will work perfectly
- Blog and dynamic content can be added later

### Option 2: Upgrade to VPS/Cloud Hosting
- For full Next.js functionality
- Requires Node.js hosting
- More complex but complete functionality

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Static pages on Hostinger
- Dynamic content via external services
- API calls to Sanity CMS

## 📊 Current Deployment Status

3. **Check image loading**
4. **Test contact forms** (if any)
5. **Monitor performance**

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Static Hosting Limitations:
- **No Server-Side Rendering**: Pages are pre-built

### Workarounds:
- **Blog Content**: Can be added as static HTML pages

- **Dynamic Content**: Use client-side JavaScript with Sanity
